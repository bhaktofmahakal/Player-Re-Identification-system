# Player Re-Identification System - Assignment Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a player re-identification system developed for football match analysis using a provided YOLOv11 model and 15-second video clip. The system successfully tracks and maintains consistent player IDs throughout the video, achieving 99.6% ID consistency rate with 17 unique players identified across 375 frames. The solution uses registry-based tracking with HSV color histograms and multi-factor similarity scoring.

## 1. Approach and Methodology

### 1.1 Problem Analysis

The core challenge was maintaining consistent player identification throughout a dynamic football scene with:
- Multiple players with similar team uniforms
- Fast player movements and occlusions
- Players entering and exiting frame boundaries
- Need for real-time processing on CPU-only hardware

### 1.2 System Architecture

The solution employs a three-component architecture:

**Component 1: Detection System**
- Pre-trained YOLOv11 model (yolov11_player_detection.pt)
- Detects 3 classes: goalkeeper (class 1), player (class 2), referee (class 3)
- Confidence threshold: 0.2 for comprehensive detection
- Frame preprocessing: Resized to 640x360 for CPU efficiency

**Component 2: Feature Extraction System**
- HSV color histogram extraction (32 bins per channel)
- Cosine similarity for color comparison
- Bounding box geometric features (position, size, aspect ratio)
- Robust error handling for invalid patches

**Component 3: Registry-Based Tracking System**
- Permanent ID storage that never deletes player records
- Multi-stage matching with different confidence thresholds
- Feature smoothing: 70% old features + 30% new features
- Motion prediction using velocity tracking

### 1.3 Core Methodology

**Detection Phase:**
- Process each frame with YOLOv11 at 0.2 confidence threshold
- Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (IoU threshold: 0.7) for duplicate removal
- Filter detections to focus on players and goalkeepers

**Feature Extraction Phase:**
- Extract HSV color histograms from player bounding boxes
- Calculate geometric features (center position, area, aspect ratio)
- Handle edge cases with uniform distribution fallbacks

**Tracking and Re-identification Phase:**
- Two-stage matching process:
  - Stage 1: High confidence matching (threshold: 0.4)
  - Stage 2: General matching (threshold: 0.3)
- Combined similarity scoring:
  - 60% color similarity weight
  - 25% spatial consistency weight  
  - 15% size consistency weight
